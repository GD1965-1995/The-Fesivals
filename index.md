Hi festival goers, Im Kame. I have been to many music festivals throughout the country. Music festivals are some of my favorite places on earth, they encourage freedom, creativity, authenticity, and incredible levels of fun. What could be better? The festival experience can be improved by knowledge about what you need for the fesival your going to, who will play there, and how you will get there.

Music festivals can be some of the happiest places on earth. However, they can be very challenging and even dangerous if you are not prepared. Hopefully this will give you some insight into what you will need to bring and do to maximize fun and safety.

Will this work? use the process of elimination to discover the root of your problem.

What To Bring: 
Tent, canopy, lots of water, sunscreen, bug spray, baby wipes, sufficient cash, backpack, and an open mind.

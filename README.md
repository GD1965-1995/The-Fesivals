Hi festival goers, Im Kame. I have been to many music festivals throughout the country. Music festivals are some of my 
favorite places on earth, they encourage freedom, creativity, authenticity, and incredible levels of fun. What could be 
better? The festival experience can be improved by knowledge about what you need for the fesival your going to, who will 
play there, and how you will get there.
